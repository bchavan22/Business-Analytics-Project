# **To Predict Best Team of Basketball in New Jersey**


## **Summary**:

To perform prediction analysis, I have chosen the College Basketball Stats and History website at [https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/]

Basketball is one of most popular sports in the college and professional level in the America. 
In this project, I will be comparing the performance of the teams in many ways for the 2019-2020 season to determine which team is the best performer.
I will be using various techniques and methodology taught during this course to perform analysis on selected dataset.

## **Action Plans**: 

•	I am planning to use benchmark to measure a performance using very specific indicators such as productivity per unit of measure, cost per unit of measure, cycle time of x per unit of measure or defects per unit of measure.
•	These outcomes will give us performance results and it is easy to compare with each other teams.
•	At the minimum, will include the following performance indicators for each team:
o	Number of games won 
o	Number of games lost 
o	PTS -- Total Points 
o	G -- Number of Games played during the season
o	FG% -- Field Goal Percentage 
o	2P% -- 2 Points Field Goal percentage per Game 
o	TOV -- Total Turnovers

Expectations:

Apply all the knowledge of lessons learned in class, in additional try out more Business analytics techniques on the data set, to find out what could be more scope of study in different area. The main aim of project to gain experience in versatile Business analytics subject.

Using Tools:

I have decided to use Excel and functions such as Min, Max, Sum, Average, Count, Count IF, VlookUp to ease analysis work. I will also use some of the different features of Excel like Dashboard, ICON Sets, Sparklines, Descriptive Statistics, Predictive Model. This will be new function for me Use the Slicer functionality to slice the data
